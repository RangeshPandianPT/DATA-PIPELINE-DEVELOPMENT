## üìä Data Preprocessing and Transformation Pipeline using Pandas & Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates a complete, modular, and scalable pipeline for data preprocessing, transformation, and loading using powerful Python libraries like **Pandas** and **Scikit-learn**. It is designed for real-world machine learning workflows where clean, well-prepared data is essential for building accurate models.

----

### üîß Key Features:

* **Data Loading**: Efficient CSV data loading using Pandas.
* **Missing Value Handling**: Automatic imputation for both numeric and categorical columns.
* **Feature Scaling**: Standardization of numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
* **Encoding**: Categorical features transformed using `OneHotEncoder` with `handle_unknown=ignore`.
* **Modular Pipeline**: Built with `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` from Scikit-learn for clean, reusable code.
* **Model Integration**: Includes a simple `RandomForestClassifier` to show the pipeline in action.
* **Performance Evaluation**: Uses confusion matrix and classification report to assess the model.
* **Export**: Saves the pipeline using `joblib`, processed datasets as CSV, and provides a full project report in PDF format.

### üß™ Use Cases:

This project is ideal for students, data science interns, and ML beginners who want to understand the structure of real data projects. It can serve as a base for building end-to-end machine learning solutions.

### üìÅ Files Included:

* `data_pipeline.py`: The main script.
* `sample_data.csv`: Simulated dataset.
* `report.pdf`: Project summary for internship documentation.
* `preprocessor.pkl`: Serialized transformation pipeline.
